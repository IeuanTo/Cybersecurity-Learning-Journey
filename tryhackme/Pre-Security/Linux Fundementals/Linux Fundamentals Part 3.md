Nano is an easy to use text editor built into linux, it can also be used to create files by using "nano filename". This also comes wiht a lot of options inside the editor to do extra bits, such as help, search, cut and paste. vim is an advanced text editor with a lot of changeable aspects, such as the commands used to search cut or paste. 

- Task 4 ; General/Useful Utilities
wget is a way to download files through http as if you were in the browser. wget `https://address-in-here.com`. 
You can transfer files from a host machine using Secure Copy or SCP. This allows you to move files between two machines. 
    scp file.txt user@destination:where you want it

-Task 5 ; Processes 101
Processes are programms that run on the machine. They are labled with PID X, an the X being the position of the process. These are shown using ps for individual user processes, or ps -aux for all processes. 
top is used to see real time statistics on the processes ongoing.
kill is used to end processes, using kill followed by a process PID will end it. 
    using SIGTERM, SIGKILL and SIGSTOP, will send a signal to end a process with some specifics.
