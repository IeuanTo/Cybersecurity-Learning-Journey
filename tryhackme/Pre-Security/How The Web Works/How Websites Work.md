## Tasks 
- Task 1 `How websites work`
    Two components make a website
        Front End (Client-Side)
        Back End  (Server-Side)
    Front End is what we see when we travel the internet requesting sites.
    Back End is what makes the website work

- Task 2 `HTML`
    HTML is used to build and define structure
    CSS is used to make websites palatable and nice to look at
    JavaScript is used for complex setting and interactivity
    
    HTML is madeup of elements, or tags, and tells browsers how to display content.
